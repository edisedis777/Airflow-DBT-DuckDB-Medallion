# Airflow-DBT-DuckDB-Medallion
This project establishes a cost-effective data platform leveraging Airflow for orchestration, dbt for transformations, and DuckDB for ad-hoc analysis. It aims to streamline data ingestion, transformation, and quality assurance, minimizing cloud compute costs through efficient data organization and local processing.
